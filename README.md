# COMP0087 Statistical NLP Project

We explore the code generation capabilities of different language models by fine-tuning them using the [coNaLa](https://conala-corpus.github.io/) dataset. The models of interest are:

1. [Marian-MT](https://marian-nmt.github.io/)
2. [GPT-2](https://github.com/openai/gpt-2)
3. [T5](https://github.com/google-research/text-to-text-transfer-transformer)

The fine-funed models can be found [here](https://liveuclac-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/personal/ucabsn3_ucl_ac_uk/Documents/COMP0087?csf=1&web=1&e=SU9JyS).
